Writing is serious business. It's the only medium that enhances or damages the ideas that it conveys. It's like railroad tracks. Unless they are laid out securely, no train of thought (*pun intended*) would be safe to travel on them.

We take good writing for granted all the time. You feel this as long as you sit on the other side of the table and keep consuming. It wasn't until I wrote my first piece of **public** blog post that I experienced the challenge. Private journaling doesn't count. I treat that as if I have no audience. You can't afford do that in public domain.

Same thing with e-mails and networking. Sometimes I get asked if I can *hop on a call* with someone that wants to ask questions about recruiting, schools or in general, career aspirations. Even meetings at work, a lot of them could literally be emails. And this is not say that those meetings are not important. On the contrary, some require so much critical thinking that having a verbal meeting doesn't suffice or else they suffer from poor decision making.

We have to be very critical of what we write. If it doesn't add anything to the overall message, delete it. If it's somewhat redundant, delete it. If it's too hard to comprehend, delete it. If it uses passive voice, rephrase it in active voice. Assume the reciepient has 30 seconds to read your message. Would your point come across? If not, try again. At the very least, move what you are asking to the top and then provide details later. You know what happened to our attention spans, don't you?

I gathered the following collection of valuable resources that I found useful in crafting this art. I hope to update this as I find more information on this subject.

And finally, never forget the following. 

In his Lettres Provinciales, the French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal famously wrote:

>> I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.
