The NBA is back! We had two games tonight and both of them were pretty close games even though players looked a little bit rusty. I felt pretty entertained, to be honest, I mean, how could you not be with all the virtual crowd?

The LA battle needed a few celebrity virtual fans in the front row but other than that, I thought it's the best they could do..

To celebrate NBA's return, I'd like to show a few dunks from the NBA history (and also one international game) where the defensive players careers either simply ceased to exist or they got wildly posterized.
