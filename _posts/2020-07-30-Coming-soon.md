I just wanted to give an update on what I intend to publish soon on this page. I have some ideas that are still not as crystalized as I'd like them to be and thus the delay in publishing a lot more stuff.

I'll be honest. I'm not even sure what I want from this platform. Do I want to keep it as a blog or do I change it into a website of a few useful essays/compilations/life hacks. I have a twitter account where I post about daily matters and whatnot but here I'd like to follow something more structured.

Since twitter is simply a 140-character blog, not sure if I want to have a longer version of that over here. The idea of essays sounds slightly better. On the other hand, I also think maybe I need to start a podcast (ugh I can hear the rumblings of annoyed people, I know we don't really need yet another podcast). I just think that it might be a bit better fit for the kind of tone I have in my blog. Writing is absolutely fine and I think I'll end up with a bit of both. When the topic is heavier, I may do a podcast of free-flowing thoughts instead of prose. Writing takes a lot more time and i don't really like it when it's not polished..

Anyways, I'll figure that part out but I do need feedback on what to prioritize next on this blog. Leave a comment on what you think I should do next here:

1. Building BAIL - Part 2 (in this write-up, I'd like to go into the implementation side of things, both on the backend and frontend)
2. Getting hired in software engineering: This is going to be simply a recipe style write-up which will rescue me from all the phone calls/cold emails/linkedin messages. I think I can just refer people over here for the resources I find helpful.
3. The best of the best: All-star products I use at home. Whether it's a kitchen knife, a pair of headphones, shoes, keyboard, water bottle. Everyday items but only those that served me well (or I already fell in love in such a short amount of time).
4. Retro NBA jerseys: I have this project in my mind to make a piece of art from the old retro NBA jerseys. Completely subjective- ones that I find really artistic. Timeless.
5. Youtube subscription deep-dive: Which channels I'm subscribed to and why. A bit of a review of each.
6. Security check-up. 2FA/Hardware security keys and why they are important. I have it summarized in the below email thread.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Annual security check-up because it matters:<br>1-Change all passwords to strong passwords, 2-enable 2FA/MFA on all accounts in the following desired order a) physical hardware key (e.g. Yubikey) b) app-based authenticator (e.g. Google Authenticator) c) Text/SMS 2FA</p>&mdash; Tamer AvcÄ± (@tamer_avci) <a href="https://twitter.com/tamer_avci/status/1285089496514457600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
